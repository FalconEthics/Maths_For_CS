# All the Maths you need for Software Engineering 🚀

## Why This List? 🤔

As a experienced software engineer with a Computer Science degree from the **University of London**, I know the struggle
of worrying
about whether you're learning *enough* math. In college, I was always scared that my lack of math skills would come back
to bite me later in my career. But after working in the industry, I realized that you **only need a focused set of math
concepts** to succeed in software engineering.

I always wished someone had curated a list like this, so here it is for all of you. **Mastering these topics is more
than enough to excel in software engineering.** Thank me later. 😎
